			<p>The COVID-19 pandemic shut down big cities across the world, including their transit services, and reframed how people commute permanently. While the industry continues to rebound slowly, frequent riders are finding alternative ways of transportation. In combination with more of the workforce opting to work remotely, the MTA’s daily ridership data shows that pre-pandemic ridership levels may never be reached again.

			<p>The MTA’s subway system, the first underground transit system in the United States, has seen its ridership numbers start to plateau while rebounding from the closures from the pandemic. In the second and third quarters of 2020-2021, subway ridership numbers more than doubled as expected. The industry saw another steady increase in the second and third quarters of 2021-2022, as the number of riders increased by over a third. The subway system welcomed back even more riders the following year as the ridership total increased by about 12%. However, from April to September 2023-2024 the ridership numbers have increased by less than a percent. This was the first time since the pandemic that June, August, and September all saw decreases in the number of riders from 2023-2024.
			</p>

			<p>Anthony Gouveia, the Senior Vice President of a transportation business group and Chief Engineer for the MBTA, acknowledges that the rebound will be slow and highlights a bigger problem for transportation agencies in the future.
			</p>

			<p>“We are seeing it come back, but it is coming back very slowly and a lot of that has to do with members of the workforce now are working remotely”
			</p>

			<p>According to a Forbes Advisor <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/remote-work-statistics/" target="_blank">article</a> on remote work statistics in 2024, "by 2025, an estimated 32.6 million Americans will be working remotely, which equates to about 22% of the workforce" With less of the workforce returning to in-person work, transit agencies could see the industry never fully recover to pre-pandemic levels.
			</p>

			<p>Alternate forms of transportation could also cause problems for the MTA. In an <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/remote-work-statistics/" target="_blank">article</a>
written by Angela Pachon back in May 2020, she stated “Bike counters outside Philadelphia recorded a 471% spike in cyclists on Kelly Drive, a road that, in regular times, is used by suburban car commuters avoiding the highway.” With a combination of fewer commuters working in person and more finding different ways of transportation, agencies around the world are seeing their numbers not return to pre-pandemic levels.

		<p>Before the pandemic, the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) transported just under 250,000 people per day on average, many of these commuters going to work in the city. In 2020, the average dropped by almost 80% as train stations were shut down and people were moved to remote work.
		</p>
		<p>Gouveia highlights that these numbers are predicted to recover quicker than intercity lines as the reliance on these lines is greater.
		</p>
		<p>“The recovery we see, a lot of times, is on the commuter rail system, on the suburban lines… 20 and 30 miles out.”
		</p>
		<p>After a year of the pandemic, the number of commuters saw a solid increase to just under 100,000 people per day. As more restrictions started to be lifted and more of the workforce went back to in-person work, the LIRR daily ridership average rose to 60% of that pre-pandemic in 2022. In the present day, the LIRR hasn’t fully recovered, but it's getting close. Numbers are 80 percent of that from before the pandemic but the interesting thing is what days of the week people are traveling on more frequently. In 2020, the day that saw the most commuters was Monday. In 2024, Monday is the least traveled weekday, seeing more daily riders than only Saturday and Sunday, suggesting that fewer people are going in to work on Mondays.
		</p>
		<p>Gouveia acknowledges the shift in the numbers.
		</p>
		<p>“If you look at some of the ridership on Monday, it seems like the peak during the week has shifted to Tuesday or Thursday.”
		</p>
		<p>Tuesday is now the most traveled day of the week for the LIRR and it doesn’t seem like Mondays will ever rebound to pre-pandemic levels. With a shift in the data, the MTA needs to find alternative ways to retain their riders.
		</p>
		<p>Gouveia mentions how inconsistencies in arrival times are also a cause for steering riders away.
		</p>
		<p>“You get on the train, you don’t know if it's going to be 15 minutes or 50 minutes. People don’t want to have that variable within their commute time so the more reliable and consistent you could have your transit service the more likely the ridership will increase.”
		</p>
		<p>Reliability and consistency are what transit agencies are aiming for as many around the country are enacting transit improvement projects.
		</p>
		<p>“A lot of the transit agencies are in a state of “good repair” and no longer looking at extension projects. They are looking at the infrastructure they have and saying how can we get this infrastructure to a state of good repair where it’s reliable,” says Gouveia. A state of good repair in the sense of public transportation means that systems are in good working order and free of defects that could affect operations. Transit agencies are hoping projects like these offer a strong recovery. 
		</p>
		<p>According to its mission statement, the MTA  preserves and enhances the quality of life and economic health of the region it serves through the cost-efficient provision of safe, on-time, reliable, and clean transportation services. With a commitment to enhancing the service and providing reliable transportation, the MTA is positioned to continue to recover from the pandemic.
